# Photo-gallery-using-laravel
INTRODUCTION-
This website is inspired by the pixabay and unsplash where people can share their picture which any user can use for their projects (open source), they can also like and share it with their friends. The website is really simple no frontend framework has been used. Maybe in the future, I will implement it in a Vue.js framework.This website is from users who are beginners and want to know how to apply CRUD operations and how to upload an image to a database and how to display it in a card view. And the images that have been use in this project are from pixabay.

Features-
•	User can upload images alongside with their title and category.
•	User can search for a picture from a specific type of category.
•	User can also perform CRUD operations (Create Read Update Delete).
•	User can also download the images.
•	User can also like someone else’s post.
•	User also has a simple dashboard.
